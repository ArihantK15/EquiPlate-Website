Bridging the Gap Between Surplus and Scarcity.

EquiPlate is a web-based platform designed to tackle food waste and hunger simultaneously. 
It acts as a logistical bridge, connecting institutions with surplus food (Hostels, Restaurants) to those in need (NGOs, Shelters) via a network of volunteer transporters.
